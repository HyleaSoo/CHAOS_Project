Oh, she long dead. She wouldn't give it up for Johannes up there so he threw her off the boat.
Did you know momma couldn't swim? You all need to work on that.
Take swimming lessons. This is how we get stereotypes.
You want help? Fine. Let me tell you a story.
"Once upon a time, a man got fucked." Now, how is that for a story?
Cause that's the story of black people in America.
Shit, you all don't know you black yet. You think you just people.
Let me be the first to tell you that you are all black. 
The moment these Dutch motherfuckers set foot here and decided they white, 
and you get to be black, and that's the nice name they call you...
Let me paint a picture of what's waiting for you on the shore. 
You arrive in America, land of opportunity, milk and honey, and guess what?
You all get to be slaves. Split up, sold off and worked to death.
The lucky ones get Sunday off to sleep and fuck and make more slaves,
and all for what? For cotton? indigo? For a fucking purple shirt?
The only good news is the tobacco your grandkids are gonna farm for free
is gonna give a shitload of these white motherfuckers cancer.
And I ain't even started yet.
A hundred years later. You're fucked.
A hundred years after that. Fucked.
A hundred years after you get free, you still getting fucked out a job and shot at by police.
You see what I'm saying? This guy gets it. I like him.
He's getting angry. Angry is good. Angry gets shit done.
You shed tears for Comp√© Anansi, and here he is, telling you, 
You are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.
He is telling you there isn't one goddamn reason you shouldn't go up there right now,
and slit the throats of every last one of these dutch motherfuckers.
And set fire to this ship!
(But the ship will burn. All of us will die.)
You are already dead, asshole. At least die a sacrifice for something worthwhile.
Let the motherfucker burn!
Let it all burn!
