莱克斯，你自己一个人————也已经没问题了吧

Very end of eternity
永恒时光的尽头
The final day has come to an end, it's gone for good
最后一天一去不返
I would then slowly close my eyes
我轻轻闭上双眼
And be cuddled by the shining memory piece
被熠熠的记忆碎片拥抱
 
I will trace back all the memories with you
追溯着与你的回忆
That's the only wish I have
这是我唯一的心愿...
 
The last day with you was truly magical
有你相伴的最后一天，仿佛转瞬即逝的魔法
The frozen time began to flow
凝固的时间开始流转
At last the longest night has gone and brought in light
漫漫长夜露出黎明
I felt myself melt in the morning light
我融化在晨曦中...
 
The final grain of sand has dropped
沙漏的最后一粒沙子落下
I will slowly so quietly fall into sleep
我缓缓地，静静地地陷入长眠
I see you gently fade away
你的身影逐渐
Your silhouette has gone the other side of the mist
被迷雾淹没
 
And all the memories with no sound so quiet
所有回忆，悄无声息，回归寂静
Just like in slow motion it moves so slowly
如同慢镜头般徐徐滚动
 
And so the last day with you was truly magical
有你相伴的最后一天，仿佛转瞬即逝的魔法
The frozen time began to flow
凝固的时间开始流转
At last the longest night has gone and brought in light
漫漫长夜露出黎明
I felt myself melt in the morning light
我融化在晨曦中...
 
You have gifted many things to me
你为我付出如此之多
(But I) wonder if I could've done the same for you
我又给回你多少
If you would let me, I will give back a handful
若我曾经有所回报
If it would put a little smile on your face
若因此换来你的微笑...
 
Can I ask you, God? Despite all of this...
即使如此，神啊
Could the sandglass somehow take back the time?
如果可以，祈求您让时间倒流
One last time is all I ask from you
哪怕只有刹那，请再一次
Can you please spare me some time with the one man I loved?
赐我与那人共处的时间，只为表达我的心意
 
I wouldn't care how and where (you could) it should be
无论何种形式，身在何方
But I need one last time I want to tell you, how I feel inside for you
最后一次，想对你说，我的真心...
I want you to know...
愿你明白...
